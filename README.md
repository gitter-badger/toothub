# TootHub

A hub for many tooters

## The Idea

Picture a world of tooters, just tooting out loud to themselves. They have no
easy way to share their toots or to discover the toots of others.

But, one day there appeared a hub of toots. People can tell the hub that they
are tooting, and the hub happily gathers their toots all together in one place
for everyone to see.

Suddenly, people can visit the hub and experience toots from other people all
around the world. In fact, people can toot at each other, and the hub will
pass the toots around. People can also toot at funny words, and everyone can
see all the toots gathered around that word.

The toot hub is a wonderful place to discover toots. 

But, what's even more wonderful is that people discovered they could conjure
up hubs of their own - for friends, colleagues, or even just themselves. 

These new hubs could be open to all, or keep a bouncer at the door checking
for invitations. Some hubs could be private, quietly watching the out loud
toots of other people for shy owners.
